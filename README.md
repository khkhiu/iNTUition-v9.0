<strong>About project</strong>

***

My project is intended for the 'Open Track', which allows participants to build anything they want. I created a simple Tetris game using javascript and HTML, by following tutorials on YouTube. The intend behind the project was to allow me to practice basic programming by building a simple project. Furthermore, I wanted to try something different for this hackathon, as all of my previous hackathon projects utilised cloud computing, like AWS.

Players use the arrow keys to play the game. A video demonstration can be found with here:

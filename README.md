# iNTUition v9.0
 
This is my repository for the iNTUition v9.0 hackathon, which took place from 25 Feb 2023 to 26 Feb 2023.

<strong>About project</strong>

***

The project is intended for the 'Open Track', which allows participants to build anything they want. I created a simple browser-playable Tetris game using Javascript and HTML by following tutorials on YouTube. The intend behind the project was to allow me to practice basic programming by building a simple project. Furthermore, I wanted to try something different for this hackathon, as all of my previous hackathon projects utilized cloud computing.

Players use the arrow keys to play the game.
